В случае с XGB это, конечно, ведет к переобучению, но вот Catboost'у связано с одним из основных его плюсов. Catboost сам по себе он очень устройчив к переобучению. Тем не менее, количество итераций, конечно, повлияло на скорость обучения (2 минуты, что гораздо больше, чем у Catboost2 и LGBM). Для LGBM построено в разы меньше моделей (100), что связано с его особенностью - скоростью. Данный гперпараметр для Catboost'а даже меньше (50), что связано с его изначальным упором на быстрый процесс обучения и с \"исходным методом повышения градиента для более быстрой реализации\" (https://pro.arcgis.com/ru/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/geoai/how-catboost-works.htm#:~:text=%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BA%2520%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%B5%D1%82%2520%D0%B8%D0%B7%2520%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%252C%2520CatBoost,%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%2520%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%81%D1%8F%2520%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE%2520%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%2520%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9.). Малое количество базовых моделей в целом позволяет моделям быстро обучаться и не переобучаться."

Большинство категориальных признаков в датасете - catboost идеально подойдет, много признаков в целом, или/и нам важна скорость - LGBM. Кажется, что XGBoost показала себя хуже всего, но лично я получила удовольствие от работы с ней во многом засчет по итогу выбитого качества (более того, сразу была видна разительная разница с линейной моделью)"

        "Так, например, в 4 кластер попали в основном рок группы (kamelot, creed, skillet и др), в 3 - r&b артисты, в 2 - танцевая, электронная музыка с примесью рока и r&b, в 1 - метал, в 0 - снова рок. Разделение, конечно, далеко неидеальное, и мы видим как жанры и даже артисты перемешиваются. Так, например, kamelot одинаково близок и к 0, и к 4 кластеру. Более того, эта группа находится ближе всего к центру в обоих случаях, что говорит о том, насколько центры 0 и 4 кластера близко расположены (а значит, возможно, их можно объединить, или рекомендовать людям, слушающим музыку из 0 кластера - исполнителей из 4, и наоборот). Но это не говорит о плохой кластеризации, скорее о различности людей и их предпочтений, ведь в конце концов один человек может мешать в плейлисте и панк, и поп, и метал, но так же о сложности задач кластеризации и ранжирования в целом. Правильный ответ найти невозможно, потому что его и нет"
